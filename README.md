### Hi there, I'm Darion! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Tech Support Engineer at Adyen, and a Hack Reactor alumnus. I've contributed to several JS/TS applications and am currently working on a few solo projects for video games I enjoy.

I'm always hungry for more, and have a keen interest in artificial intelligence, neural networks, and machine learning. If you're wondering "why didn't I go with data science and Python first?", it's because I've spent the last ~12 years working solely in customer service, and wanted to get my foot into the door of the world of programming. Web Dev seemed more approachable at the time - and there's always room to learn more. My interests went from things I watched YouTube videos of and saw on the news, to something that I'm actively working to achieve and grow with. I dream of being the difference, and shaping the future with technology.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java with a focus on backend and web services
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Discord (bots) or how/which games taught me JavaScript basics!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: darionjwilliams@gmail.com or Deep#0001 on Discord
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm reading 52 ongoing manga, concurrently! We definitely have some in common if you read it too!

## I'm confident enough with these to let you know they're in my repertoire:
